# TODO

* [decodeFromDatabase is a great idea!](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170522/036816.html)
* re-read things at every launch like field length and nullability for strings and translate them into validation rules
  * rule like: if the field is less than 256, then overflow fails. Otherwise, abbreviate
